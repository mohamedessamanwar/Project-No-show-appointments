# Project-No-show-appointments
Set: This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. ScheduledDay tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment. Neighborhood indicates the location of the hospital.
